** Queue **

Queue is a linear data structure.
Follows First In First Out (FIFO) algorithm to serve the elements.
Enqueue and dequeue done in O(1).
Used in algorithms such as Breadth First Search.


** Priority Queue **

Priority Queue is an extension of Queue with priority factor embedded.
Serves the element with higher priority first.
Enqueue and dequeue done in O(log n) using binary heaps.
Used in algorithms such as Dijkstra’s Algorithm, Prim’s Algorithms, CPU Scheduling.
